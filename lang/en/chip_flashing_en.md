# üõ†Ô∏è BIOS Chip Firmware

## How I got into this situation
I tried to update my BIOS using the firmware from the MSI website, but my laptop shut off at 5% update. I suspected that the BIOS was damaged, and this was the cause of my laptop's failure to start.

## Symptoms:
- EC reset didn't help
- After turning on, the black screen hangs indefinitely

---

## Treatment

### Necessary tools
- Heat gun
- Solder
- Active flux
- Soldering iron
- CH341A programmer (may be on the CH341B chip, this is a new revision)
- QFN8/DFN8 chip adapter

---

## Story

I had to completely disassemble the laptop, the chip was on the opposite side of the motherboard (relative to the CPU and GPU).

Next, I attached aluminum foil around the BIOS chip

</details>
and soldered it off with a heat gun.

I tried to flash the chip via NeoProgrammer and the clip that came with the programmer - nothing worked. Don't do this!

I bought a QFN8/DFN8 chip adapter, soldered the chip on it.

But even after this, the chip didn't flash. Reading the chip after flashing returned a mess.

The registers looked like this

I needed to rework the programmer. [Rework guide](../../docs/guide_ch341_ru.pdf)

Then the chip was successfully flashed.

## You will need:
- NeoProgrammer
- Choose the MX25L25673G chip (I had the MX25L25673GZ4I-08G in my laptop)
- Firmware from the MSI website. An archive of versions is located [here](ipfs_link)

### Steps:
1. Dump the chip
2. Erase the chip
3. Choose the firmware file
4. Flash the firmware into the chip

---

Next, I had to solder the chip back onto the board and assemble the laptop, which I successfully did.

And the laptop turned on

Since I successfully erased my serial numbers, I needed to restore them.
